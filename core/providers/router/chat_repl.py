"""Interactive `pal chat` REPL with a rich terminal UI.

A conversational front-end that reuses PAL's own machinery -- every model call
goes through ``server.handle_call_tool`` (the same dispatcher the MCP server
uses), so classifier routing, bandit reordering, refusal-memory and episode
logging all apply. This file adds no model-calling logic of its own.

Behaviour:
  * plain message  -> chat_router picks cheap (e.g. "hi") or smart (hard stuff)
  * /debate <q>    -> asks a small panel and prints each view
  * /delegate <m> <q> -> force model m for one question
  * /smart <q> | /cheap <q> -> force a tier for one question
  * /model, /help, /exit
